The lithium-ion battery is a remarkable device. It is the first time humanity has access to a reusable box for storing and using energy. We work on the development of polymer electrolytes that enable the rapid transport of lithium ions between the battery electrodes. Our work encompasses materials design, synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation in applications. We have developed microphase separated block copolymer electrolytes wherein one of the microphases is soft and ion-conducting, while the other is a rigid insulator. This design enables independent control over the electrical and mechanical properties of the electrolyte. We combine electrochemical characterization with advanced characterization methods such as synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography, X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, and atomic-scale cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the molecular underpinnings of our observations. While we mainly focus on fundamental studies that are published in peer-reviewed journals, we also publish patents when we perceive that our work may have direct societal impact. Based on our patents, group alumni have cofounded two battery start-up companies: Seeo (founded in 2007) and Blue Current (founded in 2014).

Chang,Professor of Chemistry; Professor of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering,https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/people/michelle-chang,mcchang@berkeley.edu,"Biochemistry, Chemical Biology, and Synthetic Biology — Designing new biosynthetic pathways for in vivo cellular production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals
Our research laboratory utilizes the approaches of mechanistic biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology to address problems in energy and human health. We design and create new biosynthetic pathways in microbial hosts for in vivo production of biofuels from abundant crop feedstocks and pharmaceuticals from natural products or natural product scaffolds. A unifying theme of all of our projects is a focus on gaining a detailed molecular understanding of how living cells control enzymatic processes within the context of the entire metabolic network. Specific projects under current investigation include (i) the in vivo production of biofuels from plant biomass, and (ii) the development of new biosynthetic methods for selective, catalytic C-F bond formation under mild conditions.
Biofuels
Sustainable energy is a significant challenge facing our planet and securing carbon-neutral sources of energy is essential to meeting growing energy demands while addressing environmental concerns. Energy and fuels produced from plant biomass offer an important renewable solution to this problem and also allow reduction in the overall release of greenhouse gases. We are constructing new biosynthetic pathways in bacterial hosts that can convert plant biomass into fuel molecules. Using synthetic biology methods, we can draw enzymes from a variety of different environmental organisms and combine them in a single genetically-engineered host. This mix-and-match approach allows us to create and tailor new biological tools for multi-step, multi-enzyme chemical synthesis.
Enzymatic Fluorinations
Natural products and their scaffolds continue to provide a rich source for the discovery and development of new therapeutics to treat human conditions ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration to microbial infections. In this regard, halogenated natural products (vancomycin and chloramphenicol) as well as synthetic drugs (Prozac, Lipitor, Cipro) encompass a growing class of important organohalogen-based pharmaceuticals. Organofluorine compounds are of particular interest as the introduction of C-F bonds can tune drug activity and specificity as well as in vivo metabolism of drugs. However, one of the major limitations in drug development is ability to selectively form C-F bonds as the available chemical methods for fluorination are difficult and typically carried out with harsh reagents without sufficient control over regio- or stereospecificity. We are developing new biocatalysts for selective and efficient C-F bond formation under mild conditions through the isolation, characterization, and mechanistic investigation of new enzymes involved in biological halogenations. These designer enzymes will have broad impact as synthetic tools for drug discovery and development."

We study materials at interfaces to address outstanding issues in the fields of adhesion and materials design. Interfaces are a region in space where two phases meet (e.g. solid-liquid, liquid-liquid), and controlling interfacial properties is necessary for multiple emerging technologies. For example, at a solid-liquid interface understanding of the interactions between the phases can give us the ability to create antifogging or self-cleaning materials, or to control and localize inks for 3D and conventional printing. Similarly, adhesives and lubricants are engineered to create sticky or slippery interfaces. Droplets, emulsions, and foams exist because of the presence of fluid-fluid interfaces, and they are central in the development of consumer products, pharmaceutical formulation, strategies for oil recovery. Beyond these materials applications, the large surface to volume ratios provided when devices are shrunk to the micro- and nanoscale create particularly exciting opportunities for device function via tunable interfacial properties.

We are a catalysis group that focuses on understanding how catalysts functions given a certain molecular active-site structure. This approach enables and is invaluable to the rational design of catalysts for emerging applications. These applications require catalysts of high activity and selectivity whereas conventional approaches often optimize one at the expense of the other. Our group is currently active in four areas:

Grafted metallocalixarene sites on inorganic-oxide surfaces, where the calixarene enforces site isolation as well as an optimized coordination geometry surrounding the metal atom;
Supported molecular metal clusters bound with calixarenes, where the calixarene enforces accessibility to open sites on the metal surface while preventing aggregation via coalescence;
Use of weak-acid sites on surfaces for biomass depolymerization, where high activity, selectivity, and lack of leaching even in the presence of metal salts can be obtained in a manner not possible with strong acids; and
Delaminated zeolites, where the high external surface area enables reactions with bulky molecules that conventionally could not fit inside a zeolitic micropore. The role of the zeolite framework in these materials is to template a preferential coordination environment surrounding a Lewis-acid metal heteroatom site for catalysis, which cannot be accomplished with conventional amorphous materials, which lack framework rigidity and order of the crystalline material.

RESEARCH DESCRIPTION
The Landry Lab's work develops synthetic bio-mimetic nanocomposites to impart control over nanomaterial interactions with biological systems for two applications: 1) to exploit the intrinsic nanomaterial infrared fluorescence for molecular imaging, and 2) to exploit the highly tunable chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials for targeted delivery of biological cargoes.
Molecular Imaging: The importance of monitoring neurotransmission is relevant to our understanding of neuropsychiatric disease, in which 'neurochemical imbalances' are at the core of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and social autism spectrum disorder. Her lab develops optical probes for neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Aberrant neuromodulator signaling in the brain has been implicated in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, whereby many drugs target neuromodulator signaling. They implement their optical probes for neuromodulators such as dopamine (Beyene et al. Science Advances 2019) and serotonin (Jeong et al. Science Advances 2019) to study addiction, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease, among others.
Targeted bio-delivery: The Landry Lab also develops nanoscale particles that enable grafting and delivery of biomolecular cargoes (DNA, RNA, protein) to plants. Despite the importance of creating transgenic plants, plant systems remain difficult to genetically transform because of the unique presence of the plant cell wall, which poses the dominant barrier to exogenous biomolecule delivery. The lab develops nanoparticle-based platforms to enable delivery of gene vectors and RNA (Demirer et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2019), and RNA (Zhang et al. PNAS 2019; Demirer et al. Science Advances 2020; Goh, Zhang et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2021) to agriculturally-relevant plants such as arugula, wheat, and cotton. Biomolecule delivery to plants can assist in plant and crop genetic engineering can solidify the agricultural industry by conferring desirable traits to plants such as increased yield, abiotic stress tolerance, and disease and pest resistance. Production of transgenic plants with nanoparticle-based DNA delivery, without trasngene integration (Demirer et al. Nature Protocols 2019; Demirer, Zhang et al. Nature Protocols 2020), can address the need for sustainable and high-yielding crops without the need to cross out transgenes. Specifically, their platform for delivery of Cas9 DNA vectors represents a platform by which to genetically modify plants without DNA integration (when delivering a DNA vector coding for CRISPR), or without DNA altogether (when delivering an RNP), potentially enabling gene-edited crops to circumvent the process of regulatory oversight as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (Landry and Mitter, Nature Nanotechnology 2020; Demirer et al. Nature Nanotechnology 2021)."

Description
Research in the Long group focuses on the design and controlled synthesis of novel inorganic materials and molecules toward the fundamental understanding of new physical phenomena, with applications in gas storage, molecular separations, conductivity, catalysis, and magnetism. We employ a range of physical methods to analyze and characterize our materials comprehensively, including by gas adsorption analysis, X-ray and neutron diffraction, various spectroscopic techniques, and SQUID magnetometry. For more information about the Long group and a full list of publications, please visit the group website.
Metal–Organic Frameworks
A major focus of research in the Long group is the design and study of metal–organic frameworks—porous, inorganic solids built of metal nodes connected by organic linkers—that are of interest for applications ranging from gas storage and molecular separations to catalysis and battery applications.
Industrial separations account for a staggering 10-15% of the total global energy consumption, and developing more efficient separations processes is a therefore key strategy toward reducing worldwide energy consumption. Additionally, now more than ever global warming is necessitating a dramatic reduction in our global greenhouse emissions. One of the most promising short-term emissions mitigation strategies—and therefore a crucial separations need—is the removal of CO2 directly from the flue gas streams of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Toward this end, we are studying a new class of diamine-appended frameworks developed in our group that exhibit high CO2 separation capacities in the presence of water, with minimal energy requirements arising from an unprecedented cooperative adsorption mechanism. Beyond terrestrial separations technologies, we are seeking to optimize this cooperative mechanism for applications as far reaching as air purification in submarines and spacecraft, and are applying fundamental insights from this work to the design of novel materials and mechanisms for the cooperative adsorption of other key, industrially-relevant gas molecules.
We are also targeting metal–organic frameworks featuring polarizing open metal sites and shape-discriminating pore structures for the enhanced binding of H2 and CH4 near ambient temperatures and the separation of hydrocarbon isomers, respectively. The high-capacity storage of hydrogen and natural gas is especially relevant for automotive transportation, as these gases represent promising cleaner alternatives to liquid hydrocarbon fuels, and yet major advances in adsorbent technologies are necessary to overcome the costly limitations currently imposed by low-temperature and high-pressure on-board storage requirements. Seeking to capitalize on the separation capabilities of our best performing framework materials and the robust nature of polymer membranes, we are also designing metal–organic framework/polymer composites toward the development of novel membranes that exhibit high selectivities and permeabilities for applications ranging from the purification of natural gas to olefin/paraffin separations.
Catalysis and Conductivity
In addition to their function as molecular sieves, metal–organic frameworks are promising as robust, efficient catalysts with isolated and well-defined active sites. We are seeking to use coordinatively-unsaturated framework metal centers as catalytic sites and also installing these metal centers post-synthetically via chelating groups built into the framework ligands. In a separate endeavor, we are using this post-synthetic modification strategy to reduce or oxidize insulating frameworks and target conductive materials with high charge densities for applications ranging from battery components to chemical sensors. Along with their unique electronic properties, we are discovering unprecedented magnetic phenomena in some of these materials, and thus these efforts represent new directions in fundamental materials science.
Molecular Magnetism
Research in the Long group is also heavily focused on the design of molecules exhibiting a strong directional dependence to their magnetization (known as magnetic anisotropy) and magnetic phenomena such as magnetic hysteresis, a property previously thought to be relegated to bulk magnetic materials. These compounds—collectively known as single-molecule magnets—were discovered in the early 20th century and are of interest for applications in information storage, spin-based electronics, and quantum computing. Nearly thirty years after their discovery, however, the highest performing single-molecule magnets still only exhibit operating temperatures as high as ~60 K, with the vast majority only functioning at temperatures of a few K—as cold as deep space. At higher temperatures, thermal energy causes random fluctuations of the molecular magnetization that precludes the controlled manipulation of spin that is necessary for practical applications.
The Long group is employing new design motifs and architectures precisely chosen to enhance operating temperatures, focusing primarily on the synthesis of multinuclear, radical-bridged molecules incorporating the late trivalent lanthanides and low-coordinate, mononuclear complexes of the transition metals. In particular, the trivalent lanthanides possess large magnetic moments and unquenched orbital angular momentum that can give rise to large magnetic anisotropy when paired with the appropriate ligand environment, and the group is a foremost leader in the design of high-performing, radical-bridged lanthanide single-molecule magnets.
While the lanthanide ions are unsurpassed in their physical properties and the fundamental advantages they bring to the design of single-molecule magnets, the increasing costs associated with lanthanide extraction are also spurring interest in the development of molecules incorporating the less costly and abundant transition metals as magnetic centers. Transition metals led the charge with the development of single-molecule magnets, as magnetic centers in large, multinuclear clusters, and the group is now targeting mononuclear transition metal complexes of iron and cobalt that exhibit “lanthanide-like” electronic structure imparted by the appropriate weak, low-coordinate ligand field. The group is also pursuing new avenues in the design of multinuclear transition metal compounds with large spin and magnetic anisotropy, as well as mononuclear and multinuclear complexes of the 5f-elements."
