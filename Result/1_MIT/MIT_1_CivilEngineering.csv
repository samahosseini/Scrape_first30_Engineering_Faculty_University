Atmospheric organics play several roles of central importance to environmental science: they affect air quality by forming secondary pollutants such as ozone; they make up a large fraction of particulate matter, with serious implications for human health and climate; and they exchange with other domains in the environment (oceans, soils, etc.), influencing biogeochemical cycles and the distribution of pollutants. A detailed understanding of these effects requires an improved characterization of the sources and evolution of atmospheric organics. Towards this end, our research group is involved in two general (and closely related) areas of research:
The development of new analytical tools for the measurement and characterization of organics in both the gas and condensed phases; andThe use of these tools in the laboratory and the field, in order to bet, nature, and chemical evolution of atmospheric organics."

This uncertainty comes from two main sources: the unknown exact equations governing the dynamics of a population���������s interactions with other populations and abiotic factors, and how and when environmental variations can change these dynamics. To assess this uncertainty, the Group adopts both a probabilistic and a systems approach rooted on the notion of structural stability. Formally, a dynamical system is said to be structurally stable if the topology of the phase portrait is preserved under smooth changes of the vector field. Because is virtually impossible to know a priori all the changing biotic and biotic factors affecting the dynamics of biological populations, it is then necessary to quantify from a probabilistic point of view the range of conditions compatible with their persistencup develops novel parametric and nonparametric methods to estimate such probabilities and to be able to understand and predict the behavior of entire ecological communities under environmental change."

Our agenda is to design network monitoring and control algorithms and economic incentive schemes that help infrastructure users and operators make optimal decisions in the presence of uncertainties. This agenda is supported by our approach to: (i) model the cyber-physical interactions in infrastructures and assess their vulnerabilities; (ii) develop tools to detect and respond to both local and network-level failures; and (iii) design incentive schemes that improve the aggregate levels of public good, while accounting for the dependencies and private information among strategic entities."
