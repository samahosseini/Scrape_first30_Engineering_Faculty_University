Stanford,,Annelise E. Barron,Associate Professor of Bioengineering,https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/annelise-barron,,"According to our recent findings and those of others, innate immune responses in humans and other mammals involving infection-, injury-, or stress-related dynamic imbalances between particular, immunomodulatory host defense peptides we study, and pro-amyloid / fibrillogenic peptides including ABeta and IAPP, may play a role in the poorly understood etiology of chronic / progressive plaque diseases, including diabetes type II melittus, atherosclerosis and Alzheimers dementia. All of these diseases involve dysbiosis, senescent/dystrophic cells, inflammation, and ""proteopathies"" or plaque accumulation; and can be complicated by infection by a variety of pathogens—bacterial, viral, and fungal.The latter disease, Alzheimers dementia, is in need of a major breakthrough in fundamental understanding, more than almost any human disease currently under study. Of a total of 450+ clinical trials initiated by Pharma towards the development of Alzheimer's treatments over the past 16+ years, almost all of these trials have failed (save two recently: Biogen's Aduhelm, and Eisai's Leqembi, which can only slow the rate of cognitive decline by 25-30% at best, and which have significant side effects). There is no current effective pharmaceutical treatment to fully halt or reverse the development of dementia. Obviously, the most fundamental ideas for what drives Alzheimers must be flawed or incomplete.Until recently Alzheimers disease was believed to be the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But in March 2014, new research published in Neurology suggested that Alzheimers may actually be responsible for as many deaths each year as heart disease or cancer—the two leading causes of death in the U.S.—due to issues, in hospitals, of improper prior determinations of underlying causes of death in the elderly.My lab is developing and testing novel mechanistic hypotheses of Alzheimers etiology, based on recent, unique molecular biophysical observations of pro-amyloid and innate immune peptides. We are also studying linkages to certain chronic infections and innate immune dysregulation.Increasing numbers of epidemiological and co-morbidity studies indicate that multiple, progressive degenerative diseases, all involving plaque deposition in various body compartments, are linked. For instance, some researchers have begun to refer to Alzheimers Disease as ""Diabetes Melittus Type III"". We seek, with current research projects, to sleuth out the shared molecular biophysical and physiological bases for these emerging linkages, so that these conditions may be prevented.(Note: Succinct, exemplary summaries of these fascinating epidemiological / comorbidity linkages are found, for instance, in the following papers: ""The ‘psoriatic march’: a concept of how severe psoriasis may drive cardiovascular comorbidity"", Experimental Dermatology (2011) 20, 303–307; ""Circle of Willis atherosclerosis: association with Alzheimer’s disease, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles"", Acta Neuropathol (2007) 113:13–21; ""Increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis"", Arch Dermatol Res (2006) 298: 321–328; ""Association of Alzheimer disease pathology with abnormal lipid metabolism"", Neurology (2011) 77;1068).",https://profiles.stanford.edu/8312

Stanford,&nbspManagement Science and Engineering,Charles (Chuck) Eesley,Associate Professor of Management Science and Engineering,https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/charles-eesley,,"I have focused on the theme of how the environment shapes entrepreneurial activity. In particular, two streams focused on how the institutional and university environment influences entrepreneurship. My work has primarily focused on formal, regulatory institutions and university entrepreneurship. While I have expanded on my work in this stream, I have broadened out this work to also include significantly more on the role of informal (socio-cognitive) institutions and entrepreneurship. In broadening my research, I have also drawn on new methods and new datasets. In particular my recent papers include randomized field experiments and data generated from digital platforms. My research focuses on the influence of the institutional environment on entrepreneurship. There are ten papers in this stream. Specifically, I have sought to do leading work investigating the types of institutional change that encourage the founding of high growth, engineering-based firms. While I build on previous work in entrepreneurship that focuses on individual characteristics, network ties, and strategy, my major contribution is to demonstrate that institutional mechanisms matter. I have sought to open up new ground by showing that effective institutional change influences who starts firms, not just how many firms are started. I have repeatedly studied entrepreneurship in a single country (China, Chile, Japan, and the U.S.) before and after a major institutional change. My work is divided into three streams: (1) institutional change and entrepreneurship, (2) university environments, and (3) sustainability and environmental activism.My research changes the way we think about how the environment – formal institutions, informal institutions, and industry contexts – influences entrepreneurship. I am at the cutting edge in situating ventures within environments and showing how interactions between environments and entrepreneurs matter. I am among the first to argue and show that policies that foster high-growth entrepreneurship are different than those that spawn small businesses. If policy leaders wish to foster technology-based start-ups, then we must consider how institutions operate. My research shows that institutional changes can significantly influence the types of firms that are created, who creates them, and how they perform. My research challenges widely accepted ideas by highlighting taken-for-granted notions that are incomplete or misleading. My studies call into question the assumption that institutions that make it easier to start firms are unambiguously beneficial. My theoretical contributions include introducing such concepts as institutional barriers to growth, skill adequacy and context relevance. I lead the way in broadening our conception of entrepreneurship beyond the developed North American economies. I have contributed methodologically by (A) showing how to measure talent, (B) collecting data internationally, (C) using randomized field experiments, and (D) analyzing multi-industry databases with state-of-the-art statistics (instrumental variables, differences-in-differences). I have been a pioneer in overcoming the challenges of inferring causality by finding changes that altered the landscape for entrepreneurship, along with collecting novel data in international settings. I have been fortunate to see an impact of my scholarship, including over 4,599 Google Scholar citations. I plan to do more studies in developing economies, especially incorporating randomized field experiments, particularly with refugees and migrant populations. I was honored to receive the Schulze Distinguished Professorship Award, the goal of which is to ""award funding to the country’s most accomplished entrepreneurship scholars who are infusing into their teaching the results of the original and meaningful research they are conducting.”",https://profiles.stanford.edu/43212

Our lab studies the mechanisms of microbiome-host interactions. Our approach is based on two technologies we recently developed: a complex (119-member) defined gut community that serves as an analytically manageable but biologically relevant system for experimentation, and new genetic systems for common species from the microbiome. Using these systems, we investigate mechanisms at the community level and the strain level.1) Community-level mechanisms. A typical gut microbiome consists of 200-250 bacterial species that span >6 orders of magnitude in relative abundance. As a system, these bacteria carry out extraordinary feats of metabolite consumption and production, elicit a variety of specific immune cell populations, self-organize geographically and metabolically, and exhibit profound resilience against a wide range of perturbations. Yet remarkably little is known about how the community functions as a system. We are exploring this by asking two broad questions: How do groups of organisms work together to influence immune function? What are the mechanisms that govern metabolism and ecology at the 100+ strain scale? Our goal is to learn rules that will enable us to design communities that solve specific therapeutic problems.2) Strain-level mechanisms. Even though gut and skin colonists live in communities, individual strains can have an extraordinary impact on host biology. We focus on two broad (and partially overlapping) categories:Immune modulation: Can we redirect colonist-specific T cells against an antigen of interest by expressing it on the surface of a bacterium? How do skin colonists induce high levels of Staphylococcus-specific antibodies in mice and humans?Abundant microbiome-derived molecules: By constructing single-strain/single-gene knockouts in a complex defined community, we will ask: What are the effects of bacterially produced molecules on host metabolism and immunology? Can the molecular output of low-abundance organisms impact host physiology?3) Cell and gene therapy. We have begun two new efforts in mammalian cell and gene therapies. First, we are developing methods that enable cell-type specific delivery of genome editing payloads in vivo. We are especially interested in delivery vehicles that are customizable and easy to manufacture.

For example, T cells can be redirected to kill cancer cells using synthetic receptors and this approach has shown remarkable success against hematologic cancers. Nonetheless, many challenges still remain unsolved to apply this therapy to a broader range of cancers. Our research integrates mechanistic cell biology and synthetic biology to understand and engineer fundamental cellular behaviors such as recognition and communication. We are currently interested in developing novel receptors and therapeutic T cells targeted to solid tumors. We are also launching new research programs to expand our approach to other molecules, cells and tissues for a variety of applications.1) Programming enhanced cellular recognition in T cellsA fundamental behavior in biology is cellular recognition. In cancer immunotherapy, highly discriminatory cell recognition would expand the applications of engineered T cells to treat solid cancers. Current CAR T cells, while effective at killing cells expressing the target antigen, fail to discriminate between high and low antigen-expressing cells. Therefore, common antigens (e.g. HER2, EGFR, and GD2) that are overexpressed in solid tumor cells cannot currently be used as good targets, as this has led in some cases to the lethal off-target killing of bystander tissues expressing lower levels of antigen. We are using principles of molecular recognition to understand and compare the limits among different strategies for engineering cellular discrimination. We recently built a two-step circuit that links a low-affinity recognition event with a subsequent high-affinity activation event. In this circuit, transcription activation, via a synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor induces expression of a high-affinity CAR. This low-to-high synNotch to CAR circuit leads to an ultrasensitive antigen density response that allows robust discrimination of high and low HER2 expressing target cells in vitro and in vivo.2) Uncovering the principles of  cell-cell communication in the tumor microenvironmentHow a tissue structure affects its function and the progression of disease are outstanding questions in cell and developmental biology with fundamental applications in cancer treatment. Tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which affects T cell migration and infiltration, remain some of the major barriers to effective solid tumor immunotherapy. Addressing these problems is challenging because tumors are complex multicellular systems. We know that T cells can recognize tumors with high specificity, and we also know that tumors modulate T cell activity via the so-called tumor microenvironment. However, we understand little about the tumor microenvironment, in particular, we do not know how tumor composition and organization mechanistically affect the response of engineered cell therapies. Our group is interested in understanding how the organization of a solid tumor affects immune cell response.We are combining cellular and tissue engineering to systematically interrogate the activity of immune cells targeted to solid tumors. We are interested in deconstructing features of tumors such as composition, structure and organization and aim for designing and building synthetic circuits that can program biomedical useful cellular behaviors to treat solid tumors.",https://profiles.stanford.edu/276913

Computations barely feasible two decades ago on the largest available supercomputers, have now become routine using turnkey commercial software running on a laptop. Demands on the analysis of new engineering systems are becoming more complex and multidisciplinary in nature, but exascale-ready computers are on the horizon. What will be the next frontier? Can we channel this enormous power into an increased ability to simulate and, ultimately, to predict, design and control? In my opinion two roadblocks loom ahead: the development of credible models for increasingly complex multi-disciplinary engineering applications and the design of algorithms and computational strategies to cope with real-world uncertainty. My research objective is to pursue concerted innovations in physical modeling, numerical analysis, data fusion, probabilistic methods, optimization and scientific computing to fundamentally change our present approach to engineering simulations relevant to broad areas of fluid mechanics, transport phenomena and energy systems. The key realization is that computational engineering has largely ignored natural variability, lack of knowledge and randomness, targeting an idealized deterministic world. Embracing stochastic scientific computing and data/algorithms fusion will enable us to minimize the impact of uncertainties by designing control and optimization strategies that are robust and adaptive. This goal can only be accomplished by developing innovative computational algorithms and new, physics-based models that explicitly represent the effect of limited knowledge on the quantity of interest.Multidisciplinary TeachingI consider the classical boundaries between disciplines outdated and counterproductive in seeking innovative solutions to real-world problems. The design of wind turbines, biomedical devices, jet engines, electronic units, and almost every other engineering system requires the analysis of their flow, thermal, and structural characteristics to ensure optimal performance and safety. The continuing growth of computer power and the emergence of general-purpose engineering software has fostered the use of computational analysis as a complement to experimental testing in multiphysics settings. Virtual prototyping is a staple of modern engineering practice! I have designed a new undergraduate course as an introduction to Computational Engineering, covering theory and practice across multidisciplanary applications.  The emphasis is on geometry modeling, mesh generation, solution strategy and post-processing for diverse applications. Using classical flow/thermal/structural problems, the course develops the essential concepts of Verification and Validation for engineering simulations, providing the basis for assessing the accuracy of the results.",https://profiles.stanford.edu/29338

The ultimate objective is to understand what makes technology-based firms successful. To answer this question, Prof. Katila conducts two interrelated streams of research. She studies (1) strategies that help firms leverage their existing resources (leverage stream), and (2) strategies through which firms can acquire new resources (acquisition stream) to create innovation. Her early contributions were firm centric while recent  contributions focus on innovation in the context of competitive interaction and ecosystems. Professor Katila's work has appeared in the Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Organization Science, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, Strategy Science, Strategic Management Journal, Research Policy and other outlets.

Because 2D materials exhibit a wide range of electronic characteristics with properties that often rival conventional electronic materials — e.g., metals, semiconductors, insulators, and superconductors — it is possible to combine them in virtually infinite variety to achieve diverse heterostructures. Furthermore, the van der Waals interface enables interlayer twist engineering to modify the interlayer symmetry, periodic potential (moiré superlattice), and hybridization, which has resulted in novel quantum states of matter. Many of these heterostructures, especially those involving specific interlayer twist angles, would be otherwise infeasible through direct growth. The Mannix Group is developing a unique set of in-house capabilities to systematically elucidate the fundamental structure-property relationships underpinning the growth of 2D materials and their inclusion into van der Waals heterostructures. Greater understanding will allow us to provide a platform for engineering the properties of matter at the atomic scale and offer guidance for emerging applications in novel electronics and in quantum information science.

High performance systems, like  medical imaging systems and other applications impose challenging specifications on power density and bandwidth that are difficult to achieve with current circuit topologies. Power density can be improved with better semiconductor components and passive elements, and by reducing the energy storage requirements of the system. By dramatically increasing the switching frequency, it is possible to reduce the energy storage requirements and improve bandwidth. I'm interested in the development of system architectures and circuit topologies for dc-ac and dc-dc power conversion that can reach switching frequencies of 10’s to 100’s of MHz. Switching at these frequencies will lead to efficient converters with inductors and transformers having no magnetic material to limit their high frequency performance, and with small-valued capacitors.At these switching frequencies, all inductors can be air-cored, eliminating core losses, saturation, and extending their operating temperature range. I have been involved in the development of  dc-dc converter that archives a significant reduction in peak switch voltage stress, requires small passive components with low energy storage, and provides the capability for extremely rapid startup and shutdown. Another goal of my work is to implement a value-added strategy in inexpensive printed circuit boards (PCB) by fabricating all passive devices of a power converter (inductors and capacitors) with traces, transforming the PCB into a 3-D resonant structure.

To address particularly difficult challenges, we seek to synergistically combine: 1) the design and evolution of complex protein-based nanoparticles and enzymatic systems with 2) innovative, uniquely capable cell-free production technologies.       To advance human health we focus on: a) achieving the 120 year-old dream of producing “magic bullets”; smart nanoparticles that deliver therapeutics or genetic therapies only to specific cells in our bodies; b) precisely designing and efficiently producing vaccines that mimic viruses to stimulate safe and protective immune responses; and c) providing a rapid point-of-care liquid biopsy that will count and harvest circulating tumor cells.       To address planet health we are pursuing biotechnologies to: a) inexpensively use atmospheric CO2 to produce commodity biochemicals as the basis for a new carbon negative chemical industry, and b) mitigate the intermittency challenges of photovoltaic and wind produced electricity by producing hydrogen either from biomass sugars or directly from sunlight.       More than 25 years ago, Professor Swartz began his pioneering work to develop cell-free biotechnologies. The new ability to precisely focus biological systems toward efficiently addressing new, “non-natural” objectives has proven tremendously useful as we seek to address the crucial and very difficult challenges listed above. Another critical feature of the program is the courage (or naivete) to approach important objectives that require the development and integration of several necessary-but- not-sufficient technology advances.",https://profiles.stanford.edu/6363

Stanford,&nbspManagement Science and Engineering,Melissa Valentine,Associate Professor of Management Science and Engineering,https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/melissa-valentine,mav@stanford.edu,"As societies develop and adopt new technologies, they fundamentally change how work is organized. The intertwined relationship between technology and organizing has played out time and again, and scholars predict that new internet and data analytic technologies will spur disruptive transformations to work and organizing.  These changes are already well-documented in the construction of new market arrangements by companies such as Upwork and TaskRabbit, which defined new categories of “gig workers.”  Yet less is known about how internet and data analytic technologies are transforming the design of large, complex organizations, which confront and solve much different coordination problems than gig platform companies. Questions related to the structuring of work in bureaucratic organizations have been explored for over a century in the industrial engineering and organizational design fields.  Some of these concepts are now so commonplace as to be taken for granted. Yet there was a time when researchers, workers, managers, and policymakers defined and constructed concepts including jobs, careers, teams, managers, or functions.  My research program argues that some of these fundamental concepts need to be revisited in light of advances in internet and data analytic technologies, which are changing how work is divided and integrated in organizations and broader societies.  I study how our prior notions of jobs, teams, departments, and bureaucracy itself are evolving in the age of crowdsourcing, algorithms, and increasing technical specialization.   In particular, my research is untangling how data analytic technologies and hyper-specialization shape the division and integration of labor in complex, collaborative production efforts characteristic of organizations.",https://profiles.stanford.edu/41754

Our specialization is interferometric radar, or InSAR. InSAR is a technique to measure mm-scale surface deformation at fine resolution over wide areas, and much of our work follows from applying this technique to the study of earthquakes, volcanoes, and human-induced subsidence. We also address global environmental problems by tracking the movement of ice in the polar regions. whose ice mass balance affects sea level rise and global climate. We participate in NASA space missions such as Cassini, in which we now are examining the largest moon of Saturn, Titan, to try and deduce its composition and evolution. Our work includes experimental observation and modeling the measurements to best understand processes affecting the Earth and solar system. We use data acquired by spaceborne satellites and by large, ground-based radar telescopes to support our research.TeachingI teach courses related to remote sensing methods and applications, and how these methods can be used to study the world around us. At the undergraduate level, these include introductory remote sensing uses of the full electromagnetic spectrum to characterize Earth and planetary surfaces and atmospheres, and methods of digital image processing. I also teach a freshman and sophomore seminar course on natural hazards. At the graduate level, the courses are more specialized, including the math and physics of two-dimensional imaging systems, plus detailed ourses on imaging radar systems for geophysical applications.Professional ActivitiesInSAR Review Board, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2006-present); editorial board, IEEE Proceedings (2005-present); NRC Earth Science and Applications from Space Panel on Solid Earth Hazards, Resources, and Dynamics (2005-present); Chair, Western North America InSAR (WInSAR) Consortium (2004-06); organizing committee, NASA/NSF/USGS InSAR working group; International Union of Radioscience (URSI) Board of Experts for Medal Evaluations (2004-05); National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center, Arecibo Observatory, Visiting Committee, (2002-04; chair, 2003-04); NASA Alaska SAR Facility users working group (2000-present); associate editor, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (1998-present); fellow, IEEE (1998)",https://profiles.stanford.edu/41264
